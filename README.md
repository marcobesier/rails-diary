2020-07-13 - Ruby Naming Conventions

Use snake_case for symbols, methods and variables.

Use CamelCase for classes and modules. Notice that this branch of camel case is different from the one used in Java (which would be camelCase). In Ruby, also the first letter is capitalized.

Keep acronyms like HTTP, RFC, XML uppercase.

Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for other constants.
